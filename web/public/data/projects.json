    "description": "Led a major turnaround on a complex web rebuild project for CHOP, joining at a critical juncture to stabilize frontend development, refactor architectural patterns, and reestablish delivery momentum.  I revamped the component architecture using Outline Design System (based on Lit2), streamlined code complexity, and introduced scalable patterns that reduced bugs and enabled future expansion (e.g., header/footer overrides by site section). I also provided hands-on mentorship, resolved team conflicts, and coached developers on collaboration and technical standards—transforming a stalled team into a high-functioning unit.  Stakeholders credited my leadership as “instrumental” in getting the project back on track, and praised my ability to cut through ambiguity with clarity, calm, and actionable decisions.",
